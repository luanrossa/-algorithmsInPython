## Purpose
This repository contains implementations of common algorithms in Python. The main purpose of studying and implementing these algorithms is to:

- Understand how different problem-solving strategies work.
- Improve logical thinking and computational skills.
- Serve as examples for other students and programmers learning algorithms.
- Provide reference code for learning, practicing, and experimenting with different approaches.

Algorithms are essential tools in computer science and programming. They help solve problems efficiently, from searching and sorting to pathfinding and optimization.
