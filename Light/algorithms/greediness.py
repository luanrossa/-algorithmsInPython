"""
Greedy Algorithm Example in Python
----------------------------------

Problem: Coin Change (minimum coins)

ðŸ”Ž Idea:
- Always pick the largest coin denomination possible
  until the amount is reduced to zero.

âš¡ Key Characteristics of Greedy:
1. Makes locally optimal choices at each step.
2. May or may not lead to the global optimum,
   depending on the problem.

ðŸ“Š Complexity:
- Time: O(n), where n = number of coin denominations.
- Space: O(1), only storing result.

ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases of Greedy Algorithms:
- Activity selection (interval scheduling).
- Huffman coding (compression).
- Minimum spanning tree (Prim's, Kruskalâ€™s algorithms).
- Coin change (with canonical coin systems).
